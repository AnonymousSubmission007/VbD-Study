# Two Visualization tools used in our study

The main experiment of this study entailed the use of two visualization tools, <a href="https://github.com/BahadorSaket/VbD">VisExamplar</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vega/polestar">Polestar</a>, which satisfied two requirements. One is that each had to clearly embody one of the two interaction techniques examined in this paper. The other is that to have a fair comparison between these two techniques, users had to be able to learn and use the system within the duration of the experiment. As each tool adopted only one of the two interaction techniques, we compared VisExamplar, which incorporates visualization by demonstration and Polestar, which incorporates manual view specification. We previously developed VisExamplar to show the feasibility of the visualization by demonstration paradigm [46]. For this study we extended the previous implementation by adding some additional features and improving some of the underlying algorithms. Although a variety of commercial tools incorporate the manual view specification technique, we decided to use the less complicated visualization tool, Polestar, to control for external factors that might affect the study. Also, Polestar has previously been used in other studies to contrast recommendation browsing technique with manual view specification.
